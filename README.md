# Redrawn Installer
 An installer that allows you to install Redrawn Without extracting the zip file.
## Install Intructions
 there are two batch files here. one is a 32bit (x86) installer and the other one without the x86 term written down is the 64 bit installer. make sure that you run the correct batch file depending on your computer's UEFI. For example, if your processor is a 64 bit and the uefi is 32bit, then select the x86 installer. if your processor is a 32bit with a 64bit uefi, run the 64bit installer. if both apply to your processor or uefi, you know what to do.
