# Redrawn Installer
 An installer that allows you to install Redrawn Without extracting the zip file and also helps start redrawn if you can't find the redrawn folder in file explorer.
## Install Intructions
There are two batch files in this directory. One is a 32bit (x86) installer, and the other is a 64 bit installer without the x86 term written down. Make sure to run the correct batch file for your computer's UEFI. For instance, if your processor is 64-bit and your UEFI is 32-bit, choose the x86 installer. Run the 64bit installer if your processor is 32bit with a 64bit uefi. If both of these conditions apply to your processor or UEFI, you know what to do.
